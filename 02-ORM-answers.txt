1) A Ruby gem is a standerdized way of accessing libraries or 'applets' to 
add functionality to your application. The usefullness of this is quite obvious as
it allows you to import functionality easily into an app without having to write everything
new every time.

2) The difference between lazy and eager loading is that with lazy loading we wait until 
an operation is requested before running said operation. In contrast, eager loading
runs operations at runtime (or sometime before the user asks) in anticipation of
saving time later. The time needed is always the same, so the main trick is 
deciding when to spend that time.

3) The difference between CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO is CREATE TABLE tells SQL
to make a new database table, whereas INSERT INTO tells SQL to add new data 
(rows, columns) to an existing table.

4) The difference between extend and include is: extend adds class methods to a file
while include adds instance methods to a class. This means if you want to have access 
to the actual class you will need to extend it to a module. 

5) to save data (or manipulate any data) you can only do that by dealing with an
instance. That is the whole point of an instance. If you tried to save data with a 
class method, it would either fail or add data to the entire class method, which 
you would not want.

6) the query would look like: 

UPDATE character 
SET "character_name" = "Jar-Jar Binks", "star_rating" = 1 
WHERE id = 1;

7) We will need to send a call to the database to retrieve this information, as 
we are no longer storing the data in local variables.
